# LScript
A coding language where there is no functions, only words and sentences.

The language is based off of my idealistic simplistic language. I would probably never code in this thing, but for teaching people how coding works, this thing would at least let someone without even entry level coding skills make something useful.

This thing is still in heavy development, and I know there's a license to use this stuff, but if you can all chill before it's done that would be appreciated. It **will** be garbage at first, so I need to make some design choices to make this language good. Everything here is prone to change and I also don't want anyone to use any older versions even if I make changes that people don't like. When this thing is said and done, the only couple language defined words would be `define` and `print`, so you can basically make your own languages if you don't like mine.
